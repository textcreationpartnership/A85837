         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Your Petitioner (being willing to interpret that act of theirs, as well as all things elſe that happens to him from men in the moſt charitable ſenſe he can, and knowing Gods hand to rule and over-rule, as he pleaſeth in the moſt ſeemingly accidentals amongſt mortals) began thereupon to conſider with himſelf; whether God might not in his mercy deſign him, to what ſome men, in too much unkindneſs had doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſome more Apoſtolical way of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, either from houſe to houſe, here in his native Country, or (if he had but the Apoſtles gift of tongues) throughout the whole world habitable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.

<pb facs="tcp:151143:6"/>me either to remove or leap over them all: and I was, and am confident, that ſeeing I do not in this work ſeek my ſelf, but the glory of God, and the good of ſo many ſoules, if I ſhould chance to loſe my ſelf in it, I ſhould finde my ſelf and that both infinitely comforted in that loſs, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundantly recompenced for it. The chief thing then, that remaines to be done by me, is the arming my ſelf, or rather the daily ſupplicating of God to arm me, againſt the fiery darts, that Satan and his complices, wicked men, ſhall caſt at me to beat me off from this work, or to affright me in it. And (praiſed be the Lord) I have been ſo acquainted with their envy and detraction, the two prime poyſonous bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed arrowes of their Helliſh quiver, in ſome other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, that God hath honoured me with, and carried me through; that I onely ſo far fear them and the reſt of that invenomed ſheaf, as to betake me to the armour which the Lord of hoſts hath counſelled me to make uſe of againſt them, and to apply me to thoſe holy means which he hath preſcribed both for the getting that armour and the girting it on, as alſo for the exerciſing and managing it to the beſt advantage. I know that envy and detraction are as conſtant attendants upon every good action of note and eminency eſpecially, as the devill himſelf is a diligent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licous obſerver of it; that to eat out the very heart of it, if its venemous tooth can reuch it; and this to grangrene ſome of the more exteriour uſefull comely parts of it, if the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals eſcape its poyſon. But if God pleaſe to preſerve the undertaker, and to proſper his undertaking; let the Red Dragon himſelf caſt forth a whole flood of poyſon after him and that which he travails with, he can no more hurt him or hinder his effecting what he undertakes, than he could the woman cloathed with the ſun, and her bringing forth her man-child.

Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not willingly give the leaſt occaſion to any to ſin ſo highly againſt God and their own ſoules, I ſhall do my indeavour to prevent all ſuch folly, ſo far as a faithfull account of my appearing and proceeding in the buſineſs may do it.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what grounds I undertook this work, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to him with whom I dare not diſſemble: And what incouragements I have had, both from God and good men, to go on with it (ſo far at the leaſt as to make tryal how it will be reliſhed or diſgeſted by thoſe who have power either to cruſh it or crown it) are fitter for mine own breaſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than for this, or any other paper to publiſh. This every one, that knowes me, will I hope believe, that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I had ſome friends of worth and credit who furniſhed me with the particulars of this Remonſtrance (as I before hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) or elſe being a ſtranger to <hi>Virginea</hi> and the affaires thereof, I neither could have known them, nor would have rceived any information concerning them upon truſt, much leſs have preſumed the preſenting them to his Highneſs: And the truth is, There is not one particular mentioned by me, to which I cannot produce a ſufficient teſtimonie for
<pb facs="tcp:151143:7"/>the confirmation thereof, by ſuch a number of witneſſes as the Lord himſelf approves for the eſtabliſhing of every truth: And for the moſt they are ſo well known to every Planter there and trader thither (eſpecially thoſe that trade in their own perſons) as that he muſt have very little ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with either, or give little faith to both, that ſhall doubt thereof, farther than to enquire of them which all unſatisfied perſons are deſired to do. And whereas you will find ſome very fowl acts particulariſed, and yet the actors or committors not named; charge that, if you pleaſe, upon my charity, who though I had their names given me, (as there was reaſon I ſhould) and that by thoſe that are neither affraid nor aſhamed to have their names known, if it ſhall be required by any that have authority ſo to do; Yet I thought it my duty to ſilence them; that ſo the Perſons that are guilty of thoſe horrid crimes, may be the ſooner invited to repent of them, when they ſhall ſee, that upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as God hath promiſed their tranſgreſſions ſhall not be mentioned unto them by him, nor ought to be by others, ſo there is the beſt courſe taken by me, that I could, that they themſelvs ſhall never be upbraided with them; as knowing, that often times the open diſgracing men for ſome fowl facts makes them the more impudent in thoſe ſins, and the more obdurat againſt all perſwaſions to turn from them.</p>
            <p>As alſo, that this diſcovering their ſins and yet covering their names may aſſure them, that it is the deteſtation of thoſe crying crimes, not any hatred of their perſons, that occaſioned this complaint: and therefore, if, upon the tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that ſuch and ſuch ſins are committed by ſome, they find themſelves to be the men that committed them, (as tis deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they may) there will be no need to ſay to any of them as <hi>Nathan</hi> ſometimes was conſtreined to ſay to <hi>David, Thou art the man:</hi> and if themſelves then pleaſe but to confeſs
<pb facs="tcp:151143:7"/>with <hi>David</hi> one by one, I have ſinned againſt the Lord: I ſhall intercede with the Lord ſo far as I am able, that he would pleaſe to ſay to their ſoules, one by one again, what <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David, The Lord hath put away thy ſin:</hi> and if they ſhall be thus aſhamed of what they have done, tis all the ſhame is wiſhed them for ſo doing. But, becauſe by thoſe wicked deeds, they have given great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, leſt if they do eſcape the judgement of men, the ſevere judgments of God do not ſeize upon them in ſome remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, here in this life, for others to take warning thereby, and for the taking of thoſe enemies of the Lord from their farthar blaſpheming thereat.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if all this will not quiet ſome Spirits, that ſhall find themſelves concerned in this Remonſtrance, as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the publiſhing of ſuch particular crimes will cauſe an inquiſition to be made by many after the particular names of thoſe that committed them; (as indeed all men are generally too inquiſitive after other mens ſins, &amp; too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in proclaiming them) or it may be, his Highneſs himſelf may, upon the information of ſuch crimes heing commited, command the names of thoſe that commited them to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in to him, that juſtice may proceed againſt them; Let ſuch know, that if any private men ſhall inquire of me the names of thoſe whoſe particular crimes are complained of in the following Remonſtrance; I can (through his grace who ſets a watch before my mouth and keeps the door of my lips) commond my tongue ſilence as well as my pen, but I have no power over the tongues of other men farther than to beſeech them to be as carefull of preſerving others good names, as of their own; and that care of others will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and inlarge the honour of their own: and where any deſerve to have their names ſtink and rot, that they would
<pb facs="tcp:151143:8"/>ſuffer them ſo to do, without their raking too much in the noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom filth &amp; loathſome putridneſs &amp; putre of them. But, if his Highneſs command me to give him, or any deputed by him, either any or all their names; that ſo judgement may be executed upon ſome of thoſe <hi>Zimris</hi> and <hi>Achans,</hi> thoſe Colonie-deſtroying offendors, to the better appeaſing of Gods wrath gone out againſt that Colonie, and for the more happy prevention of the like provocation by others, I fear the diſpleaſure both of God and his Highneſs too much to diſobey that command. And if their names or perſons do ſuffer thereby, they may blame themſelves, who were ſo audaciouſly wicked as to do that to others without bluſhing at it, which now they are aſhamed or afraid to hear of, from others, with ſo much as being named to have done it; and take it ill to have thoſe deteſtable acts of theirs but mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before one that hath power to puniſh them, which they never ſtuck at to perpetrate before him, that hath power to damn them for them. But I forget my ſelf and the work in hand too much, in labouring thus long to ſatisfy thoſe that are enemies to both. Apologies to ſuch do but raiſe more jealouſies, and ſharp rebukes are fitter charms for ſuch Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits than ſoft anſwers.</p>
            <p>There are indeed ſome perſons of honour and integrity yet living, that had the unhappineſs to be Governours when ſome of thoſe horrid facts were commited by ſome of the Planters; And ſo they might in juſtice be charged upon their account (ſo far as the not prohibiting, oppugning, and puniſhing them could contract the guilt of them) ſhould not I be ſo juſt as to give others that fair account thereof, which I received from thoſe who abhor to juſtifie the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or condemn the righteous. Moſt true it is what <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith, That <hi>in cujus manu eſt ut prohibeat, jubet agi, ſi non prohibet admitti,</hi> In whoſe power it is to prohibit
<pb facs="tcp:151143:8"/>a crime, he commands it to be done, if he do not prohibit the doing it: or, as <hi>Seneca</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>qui n on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat peccare cum poſſit, jubet,</hi> He bids a man to ſin, that does not forbid him when be may: And he, that does not withſtand a wicked man in his wickedneſs, or puniſh him ſeverely for it, if he have power, does both animat him in his wickedneſs, and incourage others to do the like: and is thereby as really guilty of that wickedneſs, as if himſelf had committed it. But tis as true, (ſay their compurgators) that thoſe worthies, (whoſe innocency alone I deſire to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, leaving all unworthy Governours to anſwer for themſelves) had not that juſt power of prohibiting, oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and puniſhing iniquity and the actors thereof, at leaſt not that due liberty of exerciſing their power, that men of their place and authority ſhould have: but were ſo limited and bound up, by the over-ſtraightneſs of their inveſtors, that armed them with that power, or by the diſſenting of their aſſiſtants, that ſhould have ſtood by them, and acted with them, in the execution thereof; or by the inſolency and tumultuouſneſs of thoſe upon whom juſtice ſhould have been executed, That, although they abhorred &amp; abominated thoſe barbarous acts, and the wicked contrivers and actors of them; yet they were conſtrained, for the better preſervation of the publik peace and ſafety of the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as their own perſons and ſubſiſtance, to forbear that forcible withſtanding, and judicial puniſhing them, that they ſhould, and otherwiſe would have practiſed and proceeded in. Such is the inſeparable unhaippineſs and miſchief that conſtantly attends both the Governours and Governed, where the power of the Governors depends upon the favour and pleaſure of the people, or is manacled and fettered by any Plebeian Tribunes, or over-awed by any inſulting Ephori. Nevertheleſs, that the reſplendent emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies
<pb facs="tcp:151143:9"/>of thoſe Governours, or my high eſteem of their vouchers, may not ſo miſlead me, as that whileſt I am willing to excuſe them from the guilt of others ſins I ſhould unwitingly pull upon my ſelf the guilt of theirs, I humbly beſeech thoſe Governours, that as they deſire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear juſt before men, ſo they would much more labour to acquit themſelves before God. And therefore if they know ought by themſelves (as they needs muſt) more than others can charge them with, they would not reſt upon any mans juſtification of their actions, much leſs preſume them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon juſtifyable before God; but earneſtly and humbly beg of God his gracious pardon for what he knowes they have failed in or been guilty of, either by their omitting or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to exerciſe that power, that he had put into their hands, or by their otherwiſe partaking with others in their ſins, as well as for all their other tranſgreſſions; and that will not onely comfort their ſoules and quiet their Spirits againſt all that have been or ſhall be objected againſt them; but alſo add very much to their honour amongſt all good men and exceedingly indear them to God himſelf the fountain of all true comfort honour and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Then for thoſe friends of mine which pretend to be friends alſo to the work it ſelf, but not to my under taking it, though I love their reproofes better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I do others praiſes; yet I would not willingly deſerve that favour from them. It may be (&amp; the truth is I have been told as much by ſome, that I believe cordially love me) they may fear that my appearing in this buſineſs may be reputed by ſome that wiſh me well ſomewhat improper and a little Heterogeneal to my profeſſon as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; but to ſuch my humble requeſt is, that they would conſider both my profeſſion and this work a little better.</p>
            <p>If the ſhewing a people their tranſgreſſions and their ſins by my pen, when my voice, though lifted up like a trumpet
<pb facs="tcp:151143:9"/>cannot reach their eares; or if the ſhewing thoſe tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and ſins to others, that have hands long enough to reach and correct them, when they can neither be firſt ſhewn to themſelves, or if they were, would certainly be to very little or no purpoſe, as to their amendment.</p>
            <p>If when wrath is gone out againſt a people, the calling upon others that have power to help pacify that wrath by executing wrath upon thoſe that provoked it; when the party that ſo calls upon others hath neither power nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to do it himſelf.</p>
            <p>If to give a people warning when they are haſtening to ruin and deſtruction, and the ſupplicating others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their utmoſt for the preventing it, if it be poſſible.</p>
            <p>If the ſeeking after, not one ſheep, but a whole flock, that are gone aſtray, and in danger to be loſt for ever; and the deſire to bring home to the ſame fold with them and after them, millions of ſouls more, that never yet were of that fold, but have promiſes from the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard that they ſhall one day be brought into it.</p>
            <p>If the complaining of poor injured, oppreſſed, inſlaved Chriſtian ſervants, under moſt unjuſt, cruel, tyrannical, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Maſters, to ſuch as have more power over thoſe Maſters, than they have over their ſervants, though both muſt remember that themſelves have another Maſter in heaven, to whom they muſt give account both of themſelves and of their ſervants.</p>
            <p>If the putting in minde thoſe that are within the pale of the Church to walk honeſtly towards them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and to let their light of holy converſation ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe eſpecially that ſit in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death, as to invite and allure them to love the ſame light that they profeſs to walk in, and to embrace that true light which came to be their light, and lighteth every man, with all the light he hath.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151143:10"/>
            <p>In a word, if the truſting in God, who hath the hearts of all men in his hands to turn as he pleaſe, and ſo hoping that his Highneſs heart will be inclined by that God to this great and glorious work, upon his right underſtanding it; and that ſomewhat the more, becauſe he knows, that he that ſupplicates his aſſiſtance therein, never ſought any great things for himſelf, and abhorrs to beg ought of him for others, but what he believes upon good grounds to be juſt and honourable for him to condeſcend to; If theſe and the like acts and crimes to theſe, be reputed as unbecoming me, or unbeſeeming my Miniſterial function, I muſt confeſs tis my deſire (not to ſay ambition) to ſerve God by my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in theſe waies which are reputed unbecoming and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming. And if God in his mercy do but approve of me and my Miniſtry, or rather my execution of that holy office (for the office it ſelf hath God for its inſtitutor, and and will aſſuredly find him its protector and defender as well as avenger) I do no farther regard mans approving or diſapproving either, than to give no juſt occaſion to any by any offence in my life to be offended at the exerciſe of my Miniſtry, nor any juſt cauſe to any by the exerciſe of my Miniſtry to be offended with my perſon.</p>
            <p>And as in my preaching the goſpel, I have carefully and faithfully indeavoured with that great exemplar of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Epiſt. Theſ. cap. 2. v. 3, 4.</note> to ſpeak nothing of deceit or impuritie, or guile; but, as I have been allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Act. 24.16.</note> ſo I have ſpoken, not as pleaſing men but God, which tryeth our hearts: So I have, with the ſame holy Apoſtle, in all things elſe, and in this particular buſineſs in hand, exerciſed my ſelf to have allwaies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence toward God and toward man. But if I have unwittingly ſaid or done ought that does juſtly offend any ſober knowing man, (as who lives and does not
<pb facs="tcp:151143:10"/>in many things offend both againſt God and man) I ſhall upon my knowledge of it meekly acknowledge it, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave Gods and his pardon of it: as I ſhall alſo freely forgive any, that ſhall through weakneſs or ignorance take an offence at me or at any of my words or actions, when there is no offence given. Wherefore I earneſtly beſeech you that are my friends, and all others, that are friends to the publick good of others, that,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> if there be any Conſolation in Chriſt to be wiſhed by you unto me, if any comfort of love, to be expected by me from you, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit betwixt you and me, if any bowels of mercy towards that poor Colonie which I appear for, and towards thoſe miſerable heathen Indians, that I long after, yom would, inſtead of quarrelling me, or this my undertaking, fulfil my joy, conceived at the hope of ſucced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this great work, and be like minded with me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, having the ſame love both to the reforming and purging thoſe Church members of Chriſt, the Engliſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and to the incorporating into Chriſts Church the Heathen aliens, their Indian neighbours. And ſo being of one accord and of one mind, let nothing be done by any of us through ſtrife or vain glory; but in lowlineſs of minde, let us each eſteem other better than themſelves, and look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others: And thus the ſame minde will be in us, which was alſo in Chriſt Ieſus; and we ſhall in him conquer all oppoſitions, difficulties, and ſeeming impoſſibilities; yea &amp; be more than conquerours through him that loveth us. To whom with the Father and Holy Spirit be all the Glory and honour of this and all other my actions and undertakings.</p>

The people that are ſent to inhabit in that Colonie, are the moſt of them the very ſcum and off-ſcouring of our Nation, vagrants, or condemned perſons, or ſuch others, as by the looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and viciouſneſs of their lives have diſabled themſelves to ſubfiſt any longer in this Nation; and when they come thither, either know not how, or will not betake themſelves to any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber induſtrious courſe of living. And, if they chance to get ought to maintain them in their licentiouſneſs and wickedneſs, fall to practiſing their old abominable practices there, as much or more than ever they did heer. So that if they come to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or officers in the ſaid Colonie, whereby they are rendered more conſpicuous in their true colours, their idleneſs and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe evil examples do not only corrupt and taint others of the ſame Colonie but cauſe the very Heathen to loath both them and the very profeſſion of Chriſtianity for their ſakes. And can any Colonie expect to proſper, or to obtain any bleſſings from God upon themſelves and their Plantation, when they ſin more againſt God and do more provoke his wrath and indignation, than thoſe heathen whom the Lord removed out of the ſame parts of that Land, and gave it them to poſſeſs? No, 'tis to be feared, that as it will be more tollerable for thoſe heathens in the day of judgement, than for them; ſo ſome more intollerable judgments will likewiſe without ſpeedy repentance ere they are aware, be inflicted on them in the day of Gods viſiting their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities, than ever thoſe Heathen felt, whom God Caſt out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. And it muſt be Gods infinite mercy to this ſinfull Nation, if, beſides our other crying fins, This our ſending out ſuch from amongſt us, that ſo diſhonour Gods name amongſt thoſe Heathen, and cauſe them to blaſpheme it, and his Goſpel to be a reproach to them (far beyond what could have been done by them, had they been kept and puniſhed heer, as they ought to have been) do not ſo inflame and increaſe the fiery wrath and indignation of God againſt us, as that he therefore cauſe too many of us to be caſt forth or led forth captives into ſome heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eniſh, barbarous or Idolatrous Nation to be a curſe and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach amongſt them.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151143:13"/>without the conſent or knowledge of their Parents or Maſters by ſome praeſtigious Plagiaries (commonly called Spirits) into ſome private places, or ſhips, and there ſold to be tranſported; and then reſold there to be ſlaves or ſervants to thoſe that will give moſt for them. A practice proper for Spirits, namely the Spirits of Devils, but to be abhorred and abominated of all men that know either what men are, or whoſe originally they are, (even his that made them) or what their relations are, either natural, civil, or Chriſtian. A practice condemned by the very Heathen, and a Law called <hi>Lex plagiaria,</hi> made by them againſt it. And if it ſhould be tollerated, or connived at by Chriſtians, and known ſo to be of the Heathen, Let it never be expected that any of thoſe Heathen ſhould turn Chriſtians. For they may well conclude, That they that will take by force or fraud thoſe that are Chriſtians either children from their Parents, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from their Maſters or any of any relation from their friends and relations, and ſell them for ſlaves or ſervants to others, will never make any conſcience or ſcruple at all, either of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force, or ſurreptitiouſly ſtealing, or otherwiſe unjuſtly poſſeſſing or ſelling thoſe Heathen themſelves, or their children, ſervants, goods, lands, or ought elſe they can lay their hands on. And if they ſhould become Chriſtians, they are foretaught by ſufficient examples, that their being Chriſtians would be no ſecuritie or protection to them or theirs. And how this diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical practiſe does, in this and many other reſpects, cry unto God for vengeance in the cries, and moanes, and complaints, and lamentations, made by thoſe poor inſlaved children and ſervants and by all their Parents, friends and relations, may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fily geſſed at than expreſſed; and may, in probability, be enough of it ſelf, to pull a curſe and vengeance upon the whole Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Amos</hi> 2. <hi>v:</hi> 6. <hi>Joel</hi> 3. <hi>v:</hi> 6, 7, 8.</p>

               <head>II. The Miſcariges of the Planters towards the Indians, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, are chiefly theſe.</head>
               <p>Towards the Indians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Planters generally keep neither their word nor their faith with the Indians; whereas the Indians very ſeldome or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151143:14"/>never break their word or faith with them. Thus iniquity is not only folly, but ſometimes a vary contradiction to it ſelf, as well as to reaſon; for ſome that call themſelves believers, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al infidels, and prove themſelves ſo to be, and worſe, when ſome that are real infidels, prove themſelves to have more faith than ſuch hypocritical believers. And it would be found preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not faith or charity, in any, to believe or hope, that ſuch diſhonourers of the Chriſtian faith, ſhould ever prevail with the poor unbelieving Indians to believe Gods word or his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, declared to be his by them whoſe word and promiſe they have juſt cauſe not to believe. Or if God ſhould make ſuch fowl falls of ſuch falſe Chriſtians to be an occaſion to his own raiſing up thoſe unbelieving Indians, &amp; bringing them to Chriſt, as he did the falling of the Jewes to be the riches of the gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. tis to be feared ſuch a calling in of thoſe Indians, would be the utter caſting off of thoſe Chriſtians; which the Lord of his mercy forbid. And for the Indians fidelity to the Engliſh, take that for a memorable teſtimony amongſt many, and indeed it may ſtand for many: when the Maſacre was made by the indians upon the Engliſh in that Colonie, They aſſaulted, no perſons, nor invaded any man: offeſſions or goods, that they knew had bought their lands of them, &amp; covenanted with them, for them and made good their covenants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Planters have taken the Indians goods from them by force when the Indians have come peaceably to trade with them. An act to be deteſted of all that love peace and truth, much more of thoſe that have any deſire of the propagating of the Goſpel of peace and truth amongſt thoſe with whom they trade.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Planters have turned ſome of the Indians out of their places of abode and ſubſiſtence, after that the Indians have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Colonie, and to their Government, and have taken up their own lands after the cuſtome uſed by the Colonie; As they did otherwiſe alſo very unchriſtianly requite the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which one of the Indian Kings did them in fighting againſt other Indians, that were preſumed to be enemies to the Engliſh and to draw towards them to do them miſchief. For that when the ſaid King deſirous to ſhew his fidelity to the Engliſh, if not in obedience to ſome of their Commanders orders, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151143:14"/>too far with his own Indians in the purſute of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indians, and thereby loft his life in that action, as ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port (though others thought him to be taken alive by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. His wife and children (that were by him at his expiring, recommended to the care of the Engliſh (as ſome of his ſervants have given out) or, to be ſure, ought to have been taken into their ſpecial care whether ſo recommended or not, and might have been ſuch an advantage either of reducing that whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily with their friends &amp; allies to the embracing the Chriſtian faith, or at leaſt ſuch an endearing them to the Engliſh, as they have never or ſeldome had the opportunity of) were ſo far from receiving the favour and kind uſage merited by their father, that they were wholly neglected and expoſed to ſhift for themſelves. And though it be alleged by ſome, as to the former part of this grievance, that that portion of Lands, which was taken from the ſayd King before his death by an Engliſh Colonel, was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged openly in Courtto be with the conſent of the ſaid King, &amp; that hee was ſatisfied for it; Yet tis generally believed, &amp; by ſome ſtoutly aſſerted, that the ſayd King was affrighted and threatened into that acknowledgement, by the ſaid Colonel.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Planters have by their ſeveral and frequent acts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and cruelty exerciſed upon the Indians, in invading their rights and aſſaulting their perſons, made the Indians in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to deſpair of ever living peaceably by them, or having any fair converſe or commerce with them, as by their not ſuffering the Indians to hunt in thoſe woods, or to fiſh in thoſe rivers, wherein they challenge a right, and are believed by divers ſober and diſcreet men of the Colonie to have a right as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as alſo by not permitting the Indians, though ſingle, or but two or three in a company, to approach neer to any of the habitations of the Engliſh (unleſs it be of ſome few of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort and rank, who have more civility and humanity, and know better how to improve that advantage) And, if any of the Indians do chance to come into any of their Plantations, and are taken, the Engliſh oftentimesty them alive to trees and burn them to aſhes, or elſe otherwiſe murder them, without ſhewing any cauſe, farther than the pretending that the Judians are not to be truſted, though (as I but now ſaid) in their faithfulneſs and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151143:15"/>firmneſs to their promiſes they much ſurpaſs the Engliſh.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Planters did lately, viz. <hi>Anno</hi> 1656, (when a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people of the Indians, more remote from the Colonie, came down to treat with the Engliſh about ſetling of a Peace, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a liberty of trade with them) moſt perfidiouſly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly (after a declaration of their deſires and intention) mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five of their Kings, that came in expectation of a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) and brought much Beaver with them to begin the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of the commerce. This unparallel'd helliſh treachery and antichriſtian perfidy more to be deteſted than any heatheniſh inhumanity, cannot but ſtink moſt abominably in the noſethrils o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as many Indians as ſhall be infeſted with the leaſt ſent of it, even to their perpetual abhorring and abandoning of the very ſight and name of an Engliſh man, till ſome new generation of a better extract ſhall be tranſplanted amongſt them; as alſo cry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly in the eares of the Almighty for his avenging thoſe bloods upon thoſe Engliſh, who made their calling themſelves his their prime advantage of betraying thoſe poor wretches lives into their bloody hands; and by their murthering their bodies did (as much as in them lay) ſlay alſo their very ſoules and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice them to the Devil; as they have likewiſe by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated iniquity, (unleſs the deteſtation thereof, by the reſt of that Colonie and this Nation, be openly manifeſted in the ſight of the ſurviving Indians in ſome exemplarie puniſhment of thoſe murtherers) beaten off many thouſands of thouſands of ſoules from embracing that faith which would ſave them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To juſtify all theſe and many other of their matchleſs ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and impieties, eſpecially their rapines, murthers, and all ſorts of cruelties exerciſed upon the poor Indians; ſome of the Planters, having uſurped the office of publike preachers, have Proclaimed from their ſpeaking-places, That the Planters are the Saints, that have juſt right to whatſoever the Indians call theirs; &amp; may, when they have opportunity and power, turn the Indians out of all their lands and eſtates, &amp; take them into their own poſſeſſion. So far have they extended that opinion <hi>dominium fundatur in gratiae,</hi> and ſo much have they abuſed, that Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal compellation of Saints, in thoſe parts: your Highneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know the danger of their conjunction in theſe.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:151143:15"/>
               <p>Amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Planters, ſome of them, have not only dealt unjuſtly and inhumanely with the poor heathen Indians; but to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſhonour of this Nation, and the greater ſcandal of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion profeſſed by them, they did lately commit a moſt hainous outrage, and bloody fact upon ſome of their own Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that had ſeated themſelves in <hi>Mary-land;</hi> &amp; that not upon a ſuddain provoked boyling of their own blood, but, (ſo far as circumſtances could demonſtrate their intention) out of a Cain-like thirſting after their brethrens blood, and a ſordid coveting of their eſtates; and what leſs can the Indians from thence infere, than, that if the Engliſh invade each others poſſeſſions, and ſhed each others bloods for them, ſurely the poor contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Indians cannot hope for either juſtice or mercy from them; and therefore why ſhould they ſcruple the cutting of their throats or driving them out from amongſt them, who ſo little ſcruple the cutting each others or any others throats, and the turning them out from cohabiting in the ſame country with them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Planters (out of covetous deſire to take up great Tracts of land) diſperſe themſelves very far from each other in the Country, and uſually take up more land by an hundred parts, than they are able to manure or till, or make any uſe of: ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering themſelves thereby both uſeleſs to one another, &amp; the more unſerviceable to the publick; beſides the expoſing themſelves to be cut off the more eaſily by the Indians, when they ſhall take that occaſion, which is too often given them, as well as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this advantage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Planters obſerve no juſt order in taking up their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of land, but run up, one after another, all along by the rivers ſides; whereby they not onely prejudice others, that come after them, in their Planting and ſeating themſelves; but do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much diſcourage them from planting and ſetling themſelves at all; becauſe they cannot have any tollerable convenience of the Rivers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Planters doe generally regard the planting of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Tobacco; and that they plant ſo exceſſively, that they cannot (confidering their number of ſervants) make it up as it ſhould be. And too many will not give it the dne making that they might; and do, for the moſt of them, pack it ſo falſly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151143:16"/>and cheatingly; that the Traders thither, finding themſelves ſo abuſed &amp; couſened by them, and that, upon their complaining ther of no juſtice is done them, (becauſe moſt commonly the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties guilty are the judges) are very much diſheartned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from trading any longer with them. And if the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves do at any time bring, or ſend over upon their own account, any conſiderable quantities thereof, it proves u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſo bad, and of ſo little worth, that all charges defrayed, they can ſcarce get more by it than their labour for their pains: whereas when ſome of them, that have been carefull to have their tobacco well made, and as well pact up, have brought over of the ſame, ſix hundred pounds have been offered to one of them for one yeares profit of his plantation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Planters do ſeldome imploy their mindes and parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ought ſave the procuring a preſent ſubſiſtence and lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the purchaſing of ſtrong waters, or ſome other ſuch heating liquors, as may inflame their Spirits, and intoxicate their braines; and ſo continue their old accuſtomed debaucheries contracted in England.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Planters in the generality, doe moſt baſely cheat, and unjuſtly deal with all that trade with them, in caſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves, or any that come into thoſe parts to trade with them, happen to die there, or have any eſtates there when they die: For that all the eſtate that is found in the deceaſed's hands (be it whoſe it will be) is appriſed by certain appriſers at half its worth: And the appriſers for their paines take in a manner what they pleaſe; and the reſt of the eſtate is put into the hands of any that claim any intereſt therein, under a pretence to keep it for the true proprietors; who ſeldome get ought thereof, upon their demanding it, but are inforced, for the moſt part, to ſpend the full value thereof, and ſometimes if they will not bear that abuſe, twice as much as its value, before they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ought. And uſually they loſe both the principal eſtate, and all the charges expended for the regaining it. Which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice alone, if not ſpeedily remedied, will deterr all traders from adventuring thither, and deſtroy all trade there, and ſo ruine the Colonie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Planters, many of them doe very much abuſe and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their poor ſervants, by not allowing them that lodging
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151143:16"/>and food which is meet, cauſing many of them either to ly all the time of their ſervitude in aſh heape, or otherwiſe to kennel up and down like dogs, where they can find room; ſcarce fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them fo well as our ſcornfull ſervants here in England feed our dogs; though men of honeſty and conſcience do diſcharge their conſciences there in the good uſe of their ſervants, as the like do here.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Planters ſuffer much, and complain excceſſively of the heavy and unequal taxes laid upon them, which taxes in a great part are pretended to be impoſed for the levying and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of force to ſecure the Colony and defend them againſt their enemies; when as they are ſpent and imbezled by the officers or largeſſes of the aſſemblies of the Colony in intemperate drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other riotous and luxurious practices, ſo induſtry and temperance are diſcouraged, and idleneſs and licentiouſneſs are maintained, if not countenanced; which cannot but ſoon overthrow the beſt of Plantations.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Planters do exceedingly miſcarry in not ſetling head Townes in each County, that the people of that County, and all others that deſire to trade with them, might be drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and manage their trading in ſome certain places; and not run up and down from houſe to houſe; eſpecially when the houſes are at ſo great a diſtance from each other, as there they are, and not above two houſes together in any County except in <hi>James</hi> Town.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>The Injuries and overſights chargeable upon the traders to <hi>Virginea</hi> are more diſcernably theſe.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The Traders do very much Injurie to the Plantation in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginea</hi> by not victualing their ſhips ſufficiently for the paſſengers w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they tranſport; in ſo much that many of the paſſengers are all moſt famiſhed, before they reach thither, though the paſſage be otherwiſe fair and within convenient time: and many dy ſoon after they arrive there; which brings an ill report upon the Country, as though that killed them; when their death is to be attributed to their ill uſage and diet at ſea, ariſing from the wretched covetouſneſs of thoſe that ſet forth ſhips for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of paſſengers, meerly for gain, and that gotten chiefly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151143:17"/>by pinching and ſtarving the carcaſes of their poor paſſengers. Now, if they that are ſlain by the ſword are better than they that are ſlain with hunger, <hi>Lam</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 9. Then ſurely they that kill men by ſtarving them, deſerve more to be hanged, than they who kill men by the ſword, or otherwiſe quickly diſpatch them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ſtarving of men deſigned for a place, where men are far more precious than they are here, and may, through Gods inabling them, prove much more ſerviceable both to God and man than here they can be, aggravates that iniquity not a litle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another wickedneſs, which ſome traders thither have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed upon their paſſengers (ſcarce ever heard of before, much leſs practiſed by any that call them ſelves Chriſtians) is this, When a ſtorm or tempeſt hath happened at ſea in their paſſage from hence thither, or they have otherwiſe miſcarried, through the default of the Maſter or Pilot of the ſhip, ſo that their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage hath been tedious and diſſicult; Some of thoſe Maſters have laid all the blame upon ſome of their paſſengers; and not onely accuſed them for witches, but executed ſome of them as witches, by their own authority, and without any legal trial and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Now if heathen mariners in a deſperate death-threatning tempeſt at ſea, (after that they knew that it was ray ſed for one of their paſſengers ſakes, and was acknowledged ſo to be by that paſſenger himſelf, and were deſired by him to caſt him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and promiſed thereupon a ceſſation of the ſtorm) were notwithſtanding both unwilling &amp; afraid to caſt him over, left themſelves ſhould loſe their lives for caſting away his; or that his innocent blood might be otherwiſe required of them, and revenged on them, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. How will their tender heartedneſs and fear of ſhedding the blood of one innocent paſſenger (as they reputed him) riſe up in judgement againſt the hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and deep blood-guiltineſs of thoſe Chriſtian mariners (undeſervedly ſo called) who upon a ſmall tempeſt or other miſcarriage at ſea, or out of a covetous deſire only to gain a little the more by their paſſengers, raſhly and impiouſly impute the cauſe of that tempeſt or miſcarriage to ſome of their paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and thereupon, both accuſe, judge, and execute them without any examination, trial or conviction of them; or without the leaſt legal power to doe either unto them; not allowing them ſo much mercy as <hi>Jonah</hi> had from the mercileſs waters, nor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151143:17"/>affording them ſo much bowels of compaſſion, or liberty of Gods miraculous preſervation, as <hi>Jonah</hi> found in the belly of Hell?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Traders do very much abuſe and cheat thoſe of the Plantation, by impoſing one ſhilling <hi>per</hi> Hogſhead upon all the Tobacco that comes from thence; and without the payment thereof, will not take their Goods aboord; which is done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pretence of defraying the charge of deſtroying the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco planted in <hi>England.</hi> And this hath been practiſed two or three years laſt paſt; whereas they have not this laſt year de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the ſaid Tobacco, nor ſatisfied thoſe whom they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly imployed in that ſervice for ſome years before, but keep the Moneys ſo raiſed and collected by them, in their own hands, to a very conſiderable ſum. And although the deſtroying To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco planted in <hi>England,</hi> will not much benefit the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Virginea,</hi> becauſe the leſs Tobacco they plant there, the more of other better Commodities might be there planted and traded in, to their greater profit and advantage: yet the not ſuffering any Tobacco to be planted in <hi>England,</hi> but fetching it from other parts of <hi>America,</hi> will much advance our Engliſh Navigation, and increaſe the Cuſtomes and Excize here at home.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is one thing more, that is found by experience to have hindred the Engliſh Colony in <hi>Virginea</hi> very much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Traders thither; which your humble Remonſtrant is very tender of mentioning, becauſe it reflects too much upon a late revived Law of this Nation; and therefore it ſhall be only propounded to your Highneſs better conſideration, to examine and judge, whether the Planters in <hi>Virginea</hi> do ſuffer more thereby, or the Merchants of <hi>England</hi> gain more: and ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not more for our Nations honour and profit to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it, than it would be for that Plantations advantage to take it off. Or whether there may not be ſome expedient found out for the eaſing of that Plantation in particular, without open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a door to a worſe grievance or inconvenience to this whole Nation in general. The thing complained of by the Planters, is the prohibiting of Foreigners to trade thither. By which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition ſa they). the Engliſh Traders thither will have the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151143:18"/>Tobaco at their own rates, and ſell their own goods and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities tranſported thither at their own prices inſomuch that whereas, when the Dutch traded thither, the Planters bought ſhoos at 12. <hi>l.</hi> of Tobacco; ſince they were prohibited, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh made them to pay 50. <hi>l.</hi> of Tobacco for the like: and ſo in proportion for other commodities. And then, if any of the Plantation ſent Tobacco hither, they had the fraight thereof for 4. <hi>l. per</hi> Tun, but upon the prohibition of the Dutch they ſometimes paid 14. <hi>l. per</hi> Tun, and moſt conſtantly 8. <hi>l.</hi> or 9. <hi>l. per</hi> Tun. And whereas the Dutch would then give the Planters 3. <hi>d.</hi> per pound for their Tobacco, and give good bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for it, (which Tobacco would yield them 6 <hi>d.</hi> and 7. <hi>d. per</hi> pound; and ſo the Merchant was inabled to pay fraight, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and cuſtomes, and get tollerable gaines) ſince that, the Tobacco, for the moſt part of it, will not yield above an half penny <hi>per</hi> pound there; and when it comes to England, it will ſcarce pay the fraight and cuſtome, by reaſon of the want of that vent which it formerly had, before the Dutch planted Tobacco in their own territories; which they did not till that prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that by this means (ſay the Planters) the Plantation is in a manner ruined, at leaſt ſoon will be, if there be not a prudent and timely prevention thereof, as your Highneſs alſo ſuffers alſo not a little in your cuſtomes and exciſe, and the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themſelves by their trading. The redreſſing of all which, if poſſible, without worſe prejudice to That Plantation or this Nation, is a worke worth the undertaking and skill of the beſt and moſt prudent of both Nations, and the ſole aim of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants preſenting it to your Highneſs.</p>

               <head>IV. The great neglect of Gods ordinances, worſhip, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice throughout the whole Plantation may be aſcribed to theſe original and ſome far other additional cauſes.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The Miniſters of <hi>Virginea,</hi> too many of them, are very car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leſs and negligent in diſpenſing Gods word and ſacraments, at alſo indecent and ſlovenly in their manner of diſpenſing them.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151143:18"/>And as their careleſneſs &amp; neglect of diſpenſing Gods Ordinances occaſion the people of the Colonie to diſregard and diſiſteem them; ſo their ſlovenly and indecent diſpenſing them, cauſe both them and the Heathen to ſcorn and contemn them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are not a few of the Miniſters, whoſe wicked and prophane lives cauſe the worſhip and ſervice of God, not only to be ſlighted, but to be little leſs than abhorred, when they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate therein; As there are alſo divers, whoſe inſufficiency and inability to ſtop the mouthes of gain-ſayers, occaſion too many of the people of all ſorts to open wide their rude, prophane, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous mouthes both againſt themſelves and all others of their holy function; as alſo againſt their very office it ſelfe, and thoſe holy Ordinances about which it is converſant. And thus (as the prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſometimes complained <hi>cap:</hi> 23.) <hi>From the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets—is prophaneſs gone forth into all the Land.</hi> And the true original cauſes of both theſe miſcariages in thoſe Miniſters is this, The greateſt part of them are ſuch as went over thither not out of any deſigne or deſire to do God and that Plantation, much leſs the poor heathen thereto adjoyning any ſervice by their Miniſtery; but out of ſome by aimes and ends of their own, being indeed ſuch, as were aſhamed, or affraid, to live any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er here in this Nation; or at the leaſt ſuch as ſought only to get ſomething for themſelves, having little hopes in theſe daies eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, from the conſciouſneſs of their own unworthineſs, to procure any preferment or tollerable ſubſiſtence here: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they now live and practice there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe Miniſters, That are religious and laborious, ſuch as are worthy of double honour, both becauſe of their labouring in the word and doctrine, as alſo becauſe of their being true ſhining lights before the people in their holy exemplarie lives and converſations, have ſcarce that ſingle honour paid them that they deſerve, from the moſt; and are diſhonoured and deſpiſed by too many. Which though it ſhould not, yet it does too much diſcourage and diſhearten them in the work of the Goſpel. And 'tis but juſtice in God, that where men ſow ſparingly, they ſhould reap ſparingly: and where the people grutch to allow Gods Miniſters temporal things, for their inriching them with ſpiritual; God may therefore moſt juſtly, in a proportionable ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151143:19"/>of puniſhment, withold his conferring of ſpirituals by ſuch inſtruments upon ſuch ungratefull receivers, till they have learnt by the want of them, how to value and eſteem them better. For as the deſpiſing of Gods Miniſters is the deſpiſing of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo the undervaluing of them and their Miniſtration is the undervaluing of God himſelf, and what he confers upon men by them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Governours of that Colonie have been, divers of them, too remiſs and ſlack both in punniſhing and removing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miniſters, and in incouraging and countenancing thoſe of worth. As not long ſince, there was an inſtance given of both. When one that had taken upon him the office of a preacher being accuſed for committing of <hi>Sodomie,</hi> and convicted if not of the fact, yet of the intent and attempt, was onely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtand in ſome publick place for a ſmall time with a paper in his hat, with his crime written therein. When on the other ſide, in the year 1655. other eminent, able preachers indeed, were for no crime (unleſs for their being of a different judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in our late unhappy differneces here amongſt us, from ſome in power there amongſt them, or for their eminencie of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and parts, as well as excellency of lives above others, or at the moſt but for ſome zealous imprudency) turned out of their imployments and Livelyhood.</p>
               <p>Thus Having ſhewn your Highneſs ſome of the chief cauſes of the Epidemical diſtempers and maladies, under which the poor Plantation in <hi>Virginea</hi> grones and labours, even to the conſumption of her Spirits, and her being ready in a manner to give up the Ghoſt, the cure is half made, eſpecially if your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pleaſe to become their <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> and take them into your own hands, and exerciſe your own ſkill in correcting and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out thoſe peccant and corrupt humors, which have been preſented to you: But becauſe your Remonſtrant knowes well, that your Highneſs delights, in all incounters, to be rather in the reſerve for relief in extremity, than to command in the lighter velitations or skirmiſhes; he is therefore emboldened (with your Highneſs favor firſt ſupplicated) to adventure his own weak ſuggeſtions, for the leading on men of more ſolid judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> to deliver their opinions; and ſo to reſerve the honour as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151143:19"/>wel as art of conquering all difficulties to your ſelf, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and reſtoring of that Languiſhing and dying Colonie.</p>
               <p>The moſt therapeutical and healing medicines, and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving antidotes, that your humble Remonſtrant conceives to be moſt effectual for the curing of the preſent diſtempers in <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> and for the preventing their return upon that Colonie for the future, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Miniſters of holy and religious exemplarie lives and converſations, and well furniſhed with known and proved abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, both for teaching and governing, be fairely treated with, and by all good means and waies invited, perſwaded, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to undertake that great work of the Lord in diſpenſing his Goſpel and the precious myſteries thereof in that Nation; An undertaking of ſo much honour and glory to God, and of ſo much credit and comfort to the undertakers, as that there is not any viſible in the whole world of more, or of more probability of an happy ſucceſs: becauſe they may thereby not only recall &amp; reclaim many of their own country-men and fellow Chriſtians that have fouly erred and gon aſtray; but alſo bring into Chriſts flock and fold not a few of the long loſt Heathen. And if good <hi>Simeon</hi> could ſing ſuch a cheerfull <hi>nunc dimittis</hi> at the firſt ſeing and imbracing him, that was (and therefore becauſe he was) a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of his people Iſrael <hi>Luke</hi> 1. with what inconceivable, as well as ineffable chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs and exultation of Spirits, may all thoſe reſigne up their Spirits into Gods hands, who have not only ſeen and embraced for ſome conſiderable time, the ſame Light themſelves; but been honoured with being the inſtruments of the Gentiles ſeing and embracing that Light, as well as of Gods own ſtraying Iſrael returning unto it? (I mean his myſtical Iſrael; though I alſo highly honour the probable conjectures of my reverend and ancient acquaintance and true friend in adverſity as well as proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, Mr. <hi>Thomas Thorowgood;</hi> that thoſe Indians at the leaſt ſome of them, in <hi>America,</hi> deſcended originally from the literal Iſrael of God,) And if they which turn many to righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the ſtares for ever and ever, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. where is there the whole world thorow, the like probability, or poſſibility for Miniſters to render themſelves capable of that promiſed reward
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151143:20"/>that there is in that Plantation, and in the reſt of the adjoyning parts of that vaſt continent; whereof that Plantation is an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full door of entrance? Some pious, ſoul-ſeeking Miniſters in <hi>New England</hi> (which is upon the ſame Continent) have in very few yeares (as is by divers from thence certified) made a very fair ingreſs into that worke, more, even far more than all the Miniſters in <hi>Virginea</hi> have done in four times as long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſucceſſion, &amp; upon many times more ſeaſonable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. The Lord of that vineyard recompence the acceptableneſs and fruites of their laboures into their boſomes, and inable them and their ſucceſſors to make a proportionable progreſs in that honourable and comfortable work; and ſend the like labourers into his vineyard in <hi>Virginea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſuch a Governour be forthwith choſen and ſent over as may incourage pious and religious men both Miniſters and others, to remove thither with him or after him; ſuch a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as was before deſcribed in the complaint of the want of ſuch a one. And that he be armed with ſuch power and authority, as is meet, for the reclaiming and regulating ſuch a Plantation. Particularly, that he have power derived unto him to make and conſtitute (with the conſent of ſuch perſons of the Colonie, as the ſaid Colonie ſhall chooſe for their repreſentatives) ſuch lawes and ordinances, as may be maſt ſuitable to, &amp; agreeable with the temper of the place and people, and the good and benefit of the whole Plantation; not forgetting the having an ey and reſpect therein unto the Heathen, ſo far as they may concern them upon any occaſion: that ſo when they ſhall hear them, or have cauſe to try the common equity and juſtice of them, they may be induced to ſay of them, in ſome reſemblance to thoſe lawes which God gave to his Colonie in Canaan, as the Nations about him ſaid of thoſe. Surely this Nation is a wiſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people; For what Nation is there that hath ſtatutes and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo righteous &amp;c? And the Eſtabliſhing of ſuch lawes, and then their due obedience to them, and through obſervance of them amogſt themſelves, will be no ſmall perſwaſion to thoſe Heathen, both to ſubmit to their Government and to embrace the ſame proſſeſſion of faith with them. Or, if that power of making or conſtituting lawes be thought too abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151143:20"/>for the Governour and people of that Colony to be intruſted with; That the ſaid Governour, and ſuch repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, agreeing upon ſuch Laws between themſelves, do firſt preſent them, to the ſupream power of this Nation, by one or two or more of them; and then, after they have received his ſtamp and impreſſion of approbation, teſtified under the broad Seal of <hi>England,</hi> that they be of full force and power to oblige all the Inhabitants of the ſaid Colony, to obſerve and yield o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto them. As alſo that the ſaid Governour, have full leave and liberty to depute ſuch other ſubordinate inferiour Magiſtrates and Officers in the Country, as he ſhall find to be fit and able, and that all ſuch Magiſtrates and Officers, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible to him when he ſhall require any account from them, as himſelf ſhall be to the Supream power of this Nation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there be more care taken for the future, that perſons of better manners, and of more honeſty and piety be tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thither; both for the honour of our Nation, and of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well as for the procuring a bleſſing upon that Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the averting thoſe curſes, which thoſe wicked and ungodly wretches, heretofore planted there, have in part pulled upon it already; and do for their ſakes farther threaten it. As alſo that it be made felony, without benefit of Clergy, for any to ſteal, and otherwiſe to inſnare, any children or ſervants; and to ſell or proffer to ſell them here, or to ſend, or to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or apparently deſign, to ſend them out of this Nation to any forein parts to be ſold, without particular expreſs licence firſt obtained from the Supream power of this Nation, and the knowledge and conſent of their Parents, and friends of neereſt relation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That thoſe Planters, who have murdered their own fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Planters in <hi>Mary Land,</hi> or murdered and otherwiſe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and abuſed the poor Indians, be ſeverely and ſpeedily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, to the full ſatisfaction of both Planters and Indians, and to the vindicating of the honour of our Religion, and of the juſtice of our Nation, and to the deterring of all wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the like barbarous practiſes. And for the future, that the Laws for ſecuring mens lives and eſtates; and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of peace and juſtice, be more ſharp and ſevere, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151143:21"/>more ſtrictly executed; eſpecially for the ſecuring the Indians in their lives and eſtates, and for the Engliſh living more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and dealing more juſtly with them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Planters be otherwiſe regulated and ordered, both in the ſettling themſelves, and in the planting of Tobacco; and in other husbanding and mannaging of their Plantations, as the Governour and his Aſſiſtants, choſen out of ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the free Inhabitants thereof, ſhall from time to time, for the benefit of the publick, as well as the good of the proprietors, preſcribe and order.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That there be ſuch free trade allowed unto all that ſhall trade thither, as may be for the advancement of that Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not prejudicial to the Navigation and Trade of this Nation; which would be a work worthy of the moſt prudent of Law-Givers, and the wiſeſt of Counſellors, and without free trade allowed to that Plantation, all their trade there will ſcarce keep them from ſtarving.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That there be ſpecial care taken here, That the ſhips w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> trade thither from this Nation, be well victualled with good proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as will be ſufficient for the Paſſengers that are to be tranſported therein, (above what they that belong to the ſhip lay in for themſelves) according to the full extent of time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they uſe ordinarily to paſs; ſomething alſo being ſuperadded for extraordinary caſualties of hindrance. And when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive there, That ſome of the Plantation be impowred by the Governour and his Aſſiſtants, to examine, upon complaint made, whether the ſaid proviſions, ſo laid in, were expended, as was ordered. And if it ſhall appear by ſufficient teſtimony, that any Paſſengers were abuſed or wronged in their allowance, or otherwiſe, that thereupon there be a ſevere mulct or other puniſhment inflicted upon him or them that are found guilty: the one moiety thereof (if it be a pecuniary puniſhment) to be given to the perſon or perſons ſo wronged and abuſed, and the other to be diſpoſed of by the Governrur for the publick.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That there be certain Officers appointed in the Plantation by the Governour, for the examining the ſoundneſs, and other qualities of Tobacco and other Commodities, growing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from that Plantation; and of the juſt meaſures and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151143:21"/>weights, and the true packing up of all ſuch commodities. And what ſhall be found good and marchantable to be admitted to ſale; but what ſhall not be ſo, if it be offered to ſale, to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; and the perſons attempting to cheat Traders therewith to be otherwiſe puniſhed, as the Govenour and his Aſſiſtants ſhall ſee cauſe to appoint.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That there be ſome head townes built in each County, where the Trade of that County may be Conſtantly managed, and the publick tranſactions of all affaires be, as often as need ſhall require, heard &amp; determined, and ſo regiſtred and recorded. And that there be one chief Town or City ſo ſeated as that all ſhips, both Engliſh and ſoreiners, that Trade to that Plantation may conveniently repair unto it, and there diſcharge, if not all, yet at the leaſt one third part of their lading; and there make due entrie both in and and out, and not to depart the County till they have their diſpatch ſigned by the partie deputed by the Governour for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That in that City, and in each head Town of each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as alſo in all other places needfull and convenient there be erected fair and well-built Churches for the people of God to aſſemble in together to worſhip and ſerve him publikely, and to communicate of his holy ordinances ſolemnly and unanimouſly &amp; that they be decently beautifyed &amp; adorned both for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Religion and for the better inviting and alluring and attracting of the poor Heathen unto them, and to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe religious offices and duties, that ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently and devoutly practiſed in them; all ſuperſtitious and Idolatrous deckings and trimmings being abominated; And that there be alo pubick Schools erected for the educating both of the Engliſh &amp; of the Indians Children in good learning and in the true Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That there be a certain coyn made current amongſt them of the Planattion; that ſo the buſineſs of Trade and commerce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelvs may be tranſacted with much leſs trouble and difficultie, than now it is, by reaſon of the bukneſs of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, the onely thing yet uſed inſtead of coyn in that Colonie.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That Forts be built and maintained in all meet places, both for the keeping off all forein invaſion, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151143:22"/>or ſupreſſing any inſurrection, that may happen to be made by the Indians.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That a ſmall Pinnace be ſet forth and imployed to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſouth coaſt of <hi>Virginea</hi> that the Navigation may be more ſafe; whereas now for want of knowing that coaſt, many ſhips miſcarry in their paſſage thither. And that every year ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect number of able, diſcreet, well-armed men, may alſo be ſent out by Land to diſcover the inland Country, and the nature and ſecrets thereof: and where one company leaves off one year, there another company, with two or thre of the former for their guides, to begin the next, and ſo to go on till they have diſcovered as much as is poſſible. And of what importance and advantage this would be to this Nation, as well as to that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie, men skilled in Navigation, and that wiſh well to ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempts, eſpecially ſuch renouned Heroes as have adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their perſons in them, will ſoon inform you.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In the laſt place (which will actuate and give life and motion and promotion to all the reſt; and without which all other attempts and indeavors for the good and proſperity of that Colonie, and whatſoever elſe can be deſigned by the moſt pious and publick Spirits that are concerning any particulars mentioned, will prove vain and ineffectual.) As the great Lord of heaven and earth muſt be conſtantly and inceſſantly ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his direction, aſſiſtance, and bleſſing upon what ſhall be undertaken in this great and honourable worke; ſo the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Plantation muſt be aſſiſted, ſupported, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by a comfortable and honourable allowance, that ſo he may ſpend his time wholly (ſave what he ſpends in the more immediate worſhip and ſervice of God, and in the refreſhing and recreating his toiled body and Spirits) in and for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good of that Colonie. And that allowance need not to be taken out of any ſtock or treaſure of this Nation; but may be raiſed and leavied upon foreiners trading in that Country, and out of thoſe moneys which the Engliſh already uſe to pay wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and is by conſent of the Colonie laid upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants that come to take up land there. All which or the greateſt part thereof hath been imbezled by inferiour unworthy men; and would amount to a very conſiderable revenue, ſufficient to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151143:22"/>maintain the Governour in all his neceſſarie expences about the Government, and afford an overplus for the raiſing of forces in time of need againſt the enemies thereof, and for the doing of many other publick workes, and in a few years afford ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the publick treaſure of this Nation: and yet all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taxes and impoſitions, under which the people of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie now groan, might be taken off, which muſt not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be hoped for or expected.</p>
               <p>All thoſe informations and intimations of the preſent ſad ſtate and condition of the Engliſh Colonir in <hi>Virginea,</hi> and of the true cauſes thereof; as alſo of the ſeveral and probably-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfull meanes and waies for curing all or the moſt of her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſtempers, are humbly preſented unto your Highneſs ſerious conſideration; As the preventing its haſtening ruine is devoutly recommended to Gods gracious mercy and to your compaſſionate care. And if the ingenuity of the Indian natives, &amp; the excellency of the Country, ſuperadded to all the other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, may any way invite and quicken your Highneſs in the indeavouring its reformation and preſervation; be pleaſed to admit of ſome few inſtances of both, for thoſe many, which might be given, and have been publiſhed by others, of each.</p>
               <p>For teſtimonie of their ingenuity, ſuffer me, after ſo much tyring your patience, to recreate you with two or three tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comical ſtories, and no fictions.</p>
               <p>When the Engliſh complained to one of the neighbouring Indian Kings, that ſome of his Indians had taken away ſome of their Hoggs; He aſſured them, that it was contrarie to his will and command; but they might well forbear the aggravating that fact ſo much as they did; for that many of the Engliſh had oftentimes killed and carried away divers of his Deer. And when the Engliſh replyed, that their hoggs were all marked, ſo that the Indians might know them to be theirs, which they could not his deer. He preſently anſwered, Tis true indeed, none of my deer are marked, and by that you may know them to be mine: and when you meet with any that are marked, you may do with them what you pleaſe; for they are none of mine.</p>
               <p>At another time there were twelve of the Indians murthered by the Engliſh. For which bloody fact, the King of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151143:23"/>deſired of the Engliſh,
<note place="margin">Roanoke and wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pampege are a kind of beads current a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for money, and is as their ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold.</note> that juſtice might be executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſons that were guilty. The Engliſh yielded thereunto, but, ſaid the Engliſh, the ſatisfaction ſhall be made according to your Indian cuſtome by giving ſo much Roanoke and Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pampege for each mans life ſuch a quantity. The Indian king told them, that he expected ſuch juſtice to be done and ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be inflicted upon thoſe murderers, as the Engliſh uſed to inflict upon the like amongſt themſelves. But ſeeing that would not be granted; he required that then according to the Indian cuſtome, ſo many in number of the Engliſh, as there were Indians ſlain, ſhould bring that Roanoke and Wampam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page and tender it to him: which when they did, The Indian King, to fright them into a deeper ſenſe of that their injuſtice, told them, that he would now ſlay eleven of them, and ſend back again by the twelfth, ſo much Roanoke and Wampampege proportionably as they had ſent for the like number, that they had ſlain.</p>
               <p>Another time, there were three Indians (whereof two were of great power and honour amongſt them) that were accuſed for attempting to poyſon the Governour of the Engliſh or otherwiſe to aſſaſine him, And the Governour, upon the diſcovery thereof required of their King, that their three heads, which were in that conſpiracy, ſhould be forthwith ſent unto him, for the expiating that high offence; or elſe he and his people would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it upon the ſaid King and his people. The King being unwilling, if not affraid, by reaſon of the power, and as ſome ſay alliance of two of them, to execute juſtice in that rigour upon them all; cut of the head of one of the three, and ſent it to the Engliſh Governour by the other two. The Governour being not ſatisfied therewith, ſent thoſe two with other meſſengers to their King to know the reaſon, why he ſent him but one of thoſe heads, when he required all three. To which the King returned this anſwer. That he had ſent all the three heads, that the Governour demanded to be ſent; And if the Governour were pleaſed to return two of them back again, it was to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to his goodneſs and mercy and not to be imputed to any failing in him who had performed what was required.</p>
               <p>There is one ſtory more, which I may not omit, becauſe it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151143:23"/>ſavours not onely of wit but of more true Wiſdom and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than is uſually found in multitudes that call themſelves Chriſtians; and that is this. When ſome of the Engliſh were imployed about building an houſe, and ſome other work, for an Indian King, he being by covenant to provide victuals for them, did accordingly conſtantly provide for them, what was neceſſary, the whole ſix daies of the week through; but when the Lords day came, and he ſaw the Engliſh forbear to work, and falling to ſporting and playing, he commanded that no victuals ſhould be allowed them: which when the Engliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, they had this anſwer returned them; That the King would allow them no victuals on that day, becauſe on that day they did him no work. To which, when the Engliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; That that day was a day ſet a part to ſerve God in, and not a day to labour, or work in; It was told them again from the King; That if he did ſee them ſerve God on that day, they ſhould have what is neceſſary allowed them; but he was ſure that they could not ſerve God by ſporting and playing.</p>
               <p>Thus may you ſee, That although Wiſdom (as the ſon of <hi>Sirach</hi> brings her in ſpeaking of her ſelf, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 24.) had for a long time her dwelling in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and her inheritance in Iſrael, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. And ſo took root in an honourable people, even in the portion of the Lords inheritance, and there grew and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and ſtretched out her branches and caſt forth a ſweet ſmell, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16. And after that was tranſplanted, as the people and inheritance of the Lord was removed, or a new people and portion choſen, and they caſt out: Yet thoſe Nations, that were not, or yet are not, the Lords people, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more did, and to this day do, partake of Wiſdoms fruits; and in every Nation and People ſhe got a poſſeſſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. (as we call a ſmall portion of ground taken as the earneſt or ſeaſin of the whole) in the ſouls of many. And that earneſt or ſeaſin may in due time, (through the Law-Givers mercy and favour) intitle her to and inveſt her in all the reſt, when for the full compleating of that Prophecy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. The earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea.</p>
               <p>Then for the excellency of the Country, If your Highneſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151143:24"/>can but believe, in theſe faithleſs times, either what ſundry men of different faith in other matters, have, as it were with one ſoul, written concerning this; or what divers of approved faith are ready with one voice or mouth farther to atteſt; You may, beyond all doubting, be aſſured, That the Climate of <hi>Virginea</hi> is healthfull, the Land exceeding fruitfull, yielding great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of whatſoever corn or grain is ſown in it, and of all other fruits that are planted in it, and affording very great increaſe of all ſorts of cattel that breed in it, or that it is ſtockt withall. The Woods, which are very vaſt, abound with Deer, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſts, whoſe carcaſes, or skins, or both, are very uſefull and profitable. The Rivers are infinitely ſtored with all ſorts of excellent Fiſh, and water-Fowls; as the dry Land is with other fowls. The bowels of the earth are fraught with admirable Mines of Iron, Lead, Copper, and (as ſome ſay) Silver: And for the upper parts thereof, beſides what it ſends forth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is much variety of delightfull and uſefull commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, It would, with a little labour and induſtry in planting, and keeping it, be made extraordinary rich in the production of Silk, Wine, Currants, Raſins, Flaxe, and almoſt any thing that any other Country yields. O that it might but once bear (as tis ſaid of <hi>Canaan, Wiſdom</hi> 12.7.) a worthy Colony of Gods children; And then <hi>Canaan</hi> it ſelf could ſcarce ever have been ſaid to have excelled it. Which that it may do, ſhall be the earneſt and inceſſant prayer of him, who daily prays that the Lord would incline, and move your Highneſs heart to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute your beſt aſſiſtance to this great work, tending ſo much to the glory of God, the propagation of the Goſpel, the good and comfort of many thouſands of ſouls in that vaſt Continent, this Nations honour, and your Highneſs higheſt renown.</p>
